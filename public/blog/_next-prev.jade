//- Create an empty array of the blog
- var blog = []
//- Iterate over the blog like you would normally
for article, slug in public.blog._data
  //- Assign the slug, which is the object key, to a value instead
  - article.slug = slug
  //- Push each article into the empty array
  - blog.push(public.blog._data[slug])

//- Iterate over the blog array
each article, i in blog
  //- Article slug is the old object key that matched the file name,
  //- Like "a-post" for example
  //- Match it against the current page
  if article.slug == current.source
      //- Previous is one before this array item
      //- Next is one after
      //- Variables make it easy to template
      - prev = blog[i - 1]
      - next = blog[i + 1]
      //- The actual links
      .row
